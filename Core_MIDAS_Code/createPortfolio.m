%createPortfolio draws a random portfolio of utility layers that fit the current time constraint

%Steps:
%1. If a portfolio is not specified as part of argument, create one at
%random. The next part of the algorithm goes one of two ways: backcasting (if there are randomly-generated portfolio items that are not currently selectable) or forecasting
%(if all portfolio items are selectable).  In either case, the output is a n x 3 matrix that tracks
%different stages of portfolios over the evaluation periods. The first row
%represents the near-term high-fidelity portfolio, last row represents the
%long-term aspiration, and middle rows represent any intermediate
%portfolios. Columns represent (1) the selected portfolio layers, (2) the
%time duration for each, and (3) a flag of high- vs low-fidelity
%portfolios.

%Algorithm for backcasting:
%1. Build portfolio by selecting layers at random until time is filled up.
%2. Check if there are any aspirational elements to portfolio
%3. If there are aspirational elements in portfolio, fill out high-fidelity portfolio with prereqs that are selectable
%4. With time remaining, fill out remaining high-fidelity portfolio with other selectable layers
%5. If there are prereqs, set high-fidelity portfolio duration to max prereq duration or agent evaluation period, whichever is shorter
%6. Check if agent wealth + income accumulated during high-fidelity part would be enough to afford aspirational element
    %6a. If not enough resources, remove any layers that have "expired"
    %(e.g. school) and replace with other selectable income-generating
    %layers as a medium portfolio. Figure out how many time periods would
    %be required to accumulate sufficient resources to afford aspiration.
    %6b. If sufficient resources are accumulated before period evaluation ends,
    %set medium term duration to this time period (extra time to accumulate resources)
%7. if there are no prereqs, set high-fidelity portfolio to max duration
%of portfolio layer or agent evaluation period, whichever is shorter
%8. Return portfolio, duration, and aspiration flag


%Algorithm for forecasting:
%1a. Identify currently selectable layers, and build portfolio using only
%these layers until time is filled up or there are no more selectable
%layers.
%1b. Check if agent already has educational training, in which case, remove
%education.
%2. Check which aspirations are enabled by selectable layers
%3. If more than one aspiration, pick one at random to be the future
%aspiration associated with this portfolio.
%4. Figure out high-fidelity duration by taking the max prereq duration or
%agent evaluation period, whichever is shorter.
%5. Return portfolio layers, duration, and aspiration flag
